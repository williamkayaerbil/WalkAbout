# WalkAbout

This directory contains the .zip file and unzipped contents of the file as unzipped on my local linux machine of the server 
code of my friend Tres Crow's web app WalkAbout.  He open sourced the code to me, and I will be adapting the code this year
to a web app of my own that plots social media data on a map for measuring water quality data as an art experience.  I've 
been slow to build the web app because I have been waiting for my focus in technical and scientific pursuits to return.

As a New Year's resolution, I wrote the following email to my colleagues and former colleagues.  A statement of intent of sorts
for the 2020's:

Publishing a Standing Rock Poetry and Photography Book to Raise Money for My Friends' Kids.

Friends,

I have a Native American friend, Ojibwe tribe, who was on the sharp end of the rope of the Standing Rock climate protests
like me for the last four years whose been on my mind recently. The protests were broken up by the military, and we
scattered back to our homes. We reside in a state of trauma. Many who went to Standing Rock already suffered from PTSD,
and in hindsight, see that as the motivation for us going to the protests in the first place. Remember friends,
Greta Thunberg's story is more of a meme than anything else. She stands as a placeholder in the media NewSpeak
public sphere for millions of people who have been on the front lines of the climate fight. We are unnamed and exhausted.
We need your help. I wrote a book that got curated by one of the top Native American museums, the Heard,
and in so doing was placed in the collection of Barnes and Noble. I have yet to find a publisher for the book,
mainly because I am so exhausted from the traveling that it took to write the book that I have not been able to
properly market it. In 2020, I will start reaching out to people on social media sites like Linkedin to find a
formal publisher.

In the 2020's decade, I will be assembling a college fund for my friends who I met on the road, and their children in
Indian country.  We need better access to the technologies of sustainability in this part of the world.  For example,
I imaging that given the opportunity Native Americans whose parents made huge sacrifices for them at Standing Rock 
would make excellent battery chemists or Telsa programmers.  It is all about taking the first step.  I left chemistry
in the 2010's because I recognized that MIT and Berkeley were not educating their students in ethics.  They give a very
good technical education, but when it comes to ethics, what I learned in kindergarten applied the best.  This is a 
shame because at the beginning of Western culture ethics was considered the highest form of learning.  Aristotle and
Plato did not create modern science and technology to serve the financial interests of big Wall Street multinationals
and the military.  I became a Christian when I was 18 years old, and I always kept that belief in my heart during my
entire time at Berkeley in my chemistry Ph.D. studies. 

I dusted off my notes after recovering from a rough 2019, and discovered some good stuff:

It is best to make small steps in the 2020's to a better future for all, not just the privileged in access to learning.
I am now back in Atlanta, the home of Martin Luther King, Jr., and getting proper treatment for my PTSD. 
Part of that treatment will be to incorporate the arts into business ventures that support funding the learning of 
those I met on the road covering the climate fight.  I kept a long prolific email train during this fight as an art
project to preserve some record of what I was going through so you could see the innards of what is going on in the 
climate change activism fight.  It is both a spiritual and a scientific battle.  I wrote a poem about this in the
book that I will close the email with as a P.S. 

Happy New Years from Atlanta, the city to busy to hate and the home of the civil rights movement!

Sincerely,
Kaya

P.S.

The Seventh Generation

“When we consider existence we see that the mineral, vegetable, animal, and human world’s are all in need of an 
educator. If the earth is not cultivated, it becomes a jungle where useless weeds grow; but if a cultivator comes
and tills the ground, it produces crops which nourish living creatures. It is evident, therefore, that the soul needs
the cultivation of the farmer. Consider the trees: if they remain without a cultivator they will be fruitless…” 

– `Abdu’l-Bahá

“What you gonna do, give up… Dear Cee, Dear Boosie… This is Lil Toochie… I love you because your life is like a movie… 
You see my daddy got killed and my mama’s on drugs, So I’m alone and I gets no love, … and I might even join a gang… 
I’m surprised you remember me… You need to educate yo’ brain… …never stimulate your pain… …take all yo’ pain and turn
it into thug motivation… …Think about the consequences… …Read yo’ Bible… …Read Psalm 51…” 

– Boosie Badazz, “Dear Cee, Dear Boosie,” Penitentiary Chances

Victim of society, you need to educate your brain in ways…
… ways that they don’t tell you in school…
You see my life is like a movie, like yours,
Like you, I’m supposed to be dead…
…told to hide our fire behind a white mask…
Boy, it’s okay…
…girl, it’s okay to be angry…
…don’t hide, don’t run, don’t let them shut you down…
Sage works, burning world needs that sweet smell,
When the drones were flying over those dogs,
I too was a small child, I ran from the land,
I was scared, I was scared at what we’ve become,
Cybernetic Rome, grassroots drying up,
The grass feels the heat,

You do I see it, I see your face,
It’s okay dear love…
…the light there in that smile…
…it’s possible to fly over walls that separate…
…they gonna build a wall on the
          Southside like they did in Jesus’s home,

Bethlehem, was where they all learned this,
What you see here is a failure to communicate,
It’s a time when teachers have to lie to please the state,
Everyone knows every child is being left behind,
No child left behind starts when you are the teacher,
I want to hear what you have to say,
Turn the tables around and speak…

What do you have to say?

What have you seen?

My seven-year-old Lakota angel what do you love?

I’ll give you a piggy back ride to the river to place tobacco in the river to know,
Let me pray with you, forget the past,
I want to remember through your eyes,
You were the one who discovered that electrons flow through the Sun Glass,
Without wires touching,
They make movies about girls like you,

Space-time waves behind your spirit and you see ghosts…
Interstellar schooled that genius father,
I saw it, and one day you will too,
Space pilot grounded to grow food on a dying planet,
He had to be brought down to earth to listen to you…
I know what it’s like to be raised by a physicist,
Little girl, you are a kinder better teacher, speak and don’t hide,
I would do anything to save you, the Seventh Generation,
This generation, the cycle breaks, no more pain…
As much as I struggle to listen, please speak,
Black holes offer a chance for ghosts to speak,

…tell me about them,
Tell me about spirits,
Tell me about angels,
Tell me about God…

What came out when they bulldozed those sites?
I saw ghosts and evil spirits in the machines,
Ghosts in the shell…
The earth was there just sitting peaceful and true,
Let me step back and rest for a while in a farm,
Let me go away for a while a month or a year or two,

My dear I’m coming back for the next lesson though,
I cannot wait, I’m working on it already,
The electric world peace prayer…
A prayer social network for our waters…
